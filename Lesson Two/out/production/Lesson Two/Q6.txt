Q6. The answer is no, length of an array can not be changed once declared
	nor can we insert or delete from it. And this is because when creating 
	an array we will give it a length of premitive defined data type and that 
	length will occupy a set of memory on the RAM and store it there, so we 
	can not change the memory allocation of each data types.
